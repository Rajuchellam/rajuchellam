                    <p>It was so gripping that I read it in one sitting. Raju Chellam nicely brings together various socio-economic aspects related to organ transplants in a medical-themed thriller. I really liked the way the author weaved in the different characters with their own personalities that reflected on how they behaved, and reacted as the story progressed. I learnt more about the processes and various regulations related to organ transplants. The book also subtly highlights with a humorous tone some of the local peculiarities and distinctiveness of Singapore. </p>

                    <p>I found myself asking, what would I do as one of the characters in the book? Jack is a medical mystery, brilliant, and unappreciated. Juxtaposed with Tyson, the book a stark example of our human condition to accept mediocrity more than startling excellence. Raju Chellam brings this to us through the stark realities of intolerance from the norm, and organ harvesting. It is a gripping tale spanning families and continents that had me captivated from the first pages. </p>

                    <p>The book shines a light on a controversial issue that I reckon all thinking adults at some point should ponder over. The key question for me is whether market economy should be allowed to extend into increasing spheres of our human existence. My personal view is there should be a limit to what money can buy. Read the book to arrive at your own stance.</p>

                    <p>Raju Chellam’s passion for technology has been evident throughout his career path, from tech journalist to editor to IT professional. Less known are his passion for medicine and matters medical, and a genuine compassion for the less fortunate.  All these attributes are amply evident in this fast-paced thriller that serves as a vehicle for exposing readers to the complex ethical questions surrounding organ donation and trading and, notably, the treatment of the often hapless players and victims. For these reasons, Organ Gold deserves a wide audience. </p>
